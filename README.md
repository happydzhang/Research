My Undergraduate Research with Professor Dong Wang

Notes for 4/20/2016
- Added venues' phone numbers to the infowindow
- Images provided by Foursquare seem to be bad links
- Hours of operation are also unreliable on Foursquare

Notes for 4/18/2016
- Fell behind in consistently working on the application as I became bogged down by assignments in other courses
- Successfully added venues' websites to the infowindow, including making them a hyperlink
- Also began to refine the search process by adding try-except blocks
- Next step is to continue to improve the range of the search function by revisiting the features of the Foursquare API
- Also, explore the JSON datasets to determine other pertinent information to go into the infowindows.
- Long-term, use the Foursquare data to jump to other social media sites for extra data

Notes for 4/6/2016
- Moved API keys into a text file to prevent access to them on Github
- Ran into a minor issue getting information about a location, such as likes, because not all venues contain those indices
- Added information like steet address to info box. Next step would be links to websites, as well as Facebook and Twitter pages
- Added the venue's rating to the info window

Notes for 3/30/2016
- Markers' info box now correctly displays venues Name
- Must implement method to include important information regarding venue in the body of the info box
- Explore how to use gitignore to store things like API Keys

Notes for 3/23/2016
- Markers are displayed with an info box
- Markers' locations determined by dataset
- Info box does not contain info regarding the dataset

Notes for 3/15/2016
- Successfully have the data crawler also write the html file
- Currently working on getting the dataset to be written to the html file

Notes for 3/2/2016
- Must develop function to loop through all elements of array of dataset
- Must find way to get dataset created from Python script into an html object
